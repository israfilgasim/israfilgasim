I enjoy solving problems, even creating new ones, asking about "how?" and "why?", simplifying complexities, and thinking outside the geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung.



<!--
As an ENTP/INTP, I thrive on problem-solving and even enjoy the challenge of creating new ones. My interests and learning span across diverse areas, ranging from mathematics and computer science to philosophy and psychology. I am particularly passionate about exploring fundamental questions, such as "how?" and "why?" related to my studies. I am a profound learner because I delve deep into every aspect of the subject to gain a thorough understanding.
